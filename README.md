# Budgets


Getting started

To use the app, simply enter an expense amount and a reason for the expense, and then tap the add button. You can also set a budget by entering a budget amount in the budget field.

The app will then calculate your total expenses and remaining budget. You can view your expenses in the list below the budget field.

Saving your data

The app automatically saves your data to SharedPreferences. This means that your data will not be lost even if you close the app.

Running the app

To run the app, simply clone this repository and run the following command in the project directory:

flutter run
This will start the app in debug mode. You can then test the app on your device or emulator.

Deployment

Once you are satisfied with your app, you can deploy it to the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store.
